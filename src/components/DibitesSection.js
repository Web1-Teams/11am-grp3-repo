          Diabetes is a chronic health condition that occurs when the body
          cannot properly regulate blood sugar (glucose) levels.This happens due
          to either insufficient production of insulin, a hormone made by the
          pancreas, or the bodyâ€™s inability to effectively use the insulin it
          produces. Insulin helps transport glucose from the bloodstream into
          cells, where it is used for energy.

    <h1> What is Insulin ? </h1>
    <p>
      It is a hormone secreted by the beta cells in the pancreas (a small organ
      located behind the stomach) <br />
      and is responsible for using glucose after it reaches the bloodstream to
      obtain energy for daily activities. <br />
      It also plays a crucial role in regulating blood sugar (glucose) levels in
      the body. <br />
      Without the secretion of this insulin or the inability to use it, blood
      sugar remains high, which causes diabetes. <br />
